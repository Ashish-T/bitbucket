To complete the installation process of Bitbucket on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), you can follow these steps:

    Update System Packages:

    sql

sudo yum update

Install Java Development Kit (JDK):
Bitbucket requires Java to run. Install JDK using the following command:

sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

Download Bitbucket:
Go to the Bitbucket website and download the latest version of the Bitbucket Server installation package (e.g., bitbucket-x.x.x.tar.gz).

Create a Bitbucket Installation Directory:
Choose a location where you want to install Bitbucket, for example:

bash

sudo mkdir /opt/atlassian

Extract Bitbucket Package:
Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Bitbucket installation package, then extract it to the installation directory:

bash

sudo tar -xvf bitbucket-x.x.x.tar.gz -C /opt/atlassian

Configure Bitbucket Home Directory:
Create a dedicated home directory for Bitbucket data:

bash

sudo mkdir /var/atlassian/application-data/bitbucket

Set Permissions:
Adjust the ownership and permissions of the installation and home directories:

bash

sudo chown -R your_user:your_group /opt/atlassian/bitbucket-x.x.x
sudo chown -R your_user:your_group /var/atlassian/application-data/bitbucket

Configure the System to Start Bitbucket Automatically:
Create a new service file for Bitbucket:

bash

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/bitbucket.service

Add the following content to the file:

makefile

[Unit]
Description=Atlassian Bitbucket
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
User=your_user
ExecStart=/opt/atlassian/bitbucket-x.x.x/bin/start-bitbucket.sh
ExecStop=/opt/atlassian/bitbucket-x.x.x/bin/stop-bitbucket.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Save and close the file.

Enable and Start Bitbucket Service:

bash

sudo systemctl enable bitbucket
sudo systemctl start bitbucket

Configure Firewall:
If you have a firewall enabled, you need to allow incoming connections to the Bitbucket port (default is 7990):

css

#install firewalld to run this command
    sudo yum install firewalld

    sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=7990/tcp --permanent
    sudo firewall-cmd --reload

    Access Bitbucket Web Interface:
    Open a web browser and visit http://your_server_ip:7990. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the Bitbucket setup.

That's it! You have now completed the installation process of Bitbucket on RHEL. You can configure Bitbucket further according to your requirements and start using it for version control and collaboration.

To configure Bitbucket to run as a service on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), you can follow these steps:

    Create a new service file for Bitbucket:

    bash

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/bitbucket.service

Add the following content to the file:

makefile

[Unit]
Description=Atlassian Bitbucket
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
User=your_user
ExecStart=/opt/atlassian/bitbucket-x.x.x/bin/start-bitbucket.sh
ExecStop=/opt/atlassian/bitbucket-x.x.x/bin/stop-bitbucket.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Replace your_user with the appropriate username.

Save and close the file.

Enable the Bitbucket service:

bash

sudo systemctl enable bitbucket

Start the Bitbucket service:

sql

sudo systemctl start bitbucket

Verify the status of the service to ensure it is running:

lua

sudo systemctl status bitbucket

You should see the service status as "active (running)".

If you need to stop or restart the Bitbucket service, you can use the following commands:

arduino

    sudo systemctl stop bitbucket
    sudo systemctl restart bitbucket

By configuring Bitbucket as a service, it will automatically start when the system boots, and you can manage it using standard service management commands.
